                                    in certain circumstances, for example low internet speed or market vulatility, the
                                    quoted price may no longer be representative of the underlying market price and may
                                    result in the Client placing his/her Order at a delay, this may result in orders
                                    being executed at a better or worse prevailing price offered by the Company.</li>

                                    likelihood of execution depends on the availability of the prices of the Execution
                                    Venue(s). In some instances, it may not be possible to arrange an Order for

                                    the fullowing examples: overnight, during news times, the opening of trading
                                    sessions, vulatile markets (where prices may move significantly up or down and away
                                    from declared prices), where there is rapid price movement, where there is
                                    insufficient liquidity for the execution of the specific vulume at the declared

                                    actually executed at. In some situations, at the time an Order is presented for

                                    <li class="agreement__terms-list-item2"> Leverage (Multiplier): The use of the multiplier toul in CFD trading enables the
                                    client to trade in the markets and increase proportionally the returns of his/her
                                    invested amount, in relation to the returns in the market. However, the maximum loss
                                    a client can incur from a trade is limited to his/her original investment amount
                                    meaning the remaining amount of his/her equity is secured. The Company applies a
                                    maximum multiplier of 1:100 for all clients by default, in line with relevant
                                    legislation.</li>

                                    (Investment Amount) on the upwards movement of EUR/USD. He/she also chooses to use a
                                    multiplier of 50 for this trade. After one day, the trader decides to close the
                                    position. At that moment, the price of EUR/USD moved from 1.153250 (opening price)
                                    to 1.158000 (closing price) or otherwise 0.41188%. The realised profit for the
                                    client will be €205.94 or otherwise 20.594%. To better understand the calculations,
                                    the invested capital increased by the percentage move in the market multiplied by

                                    position opened without the use of it. To demonstrate with the same example, if the
                                    market had moved 1% down from the opening price of 1.153250, because of the use of
