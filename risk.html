                            All investments carry risk. Different investment strategies carry different levels of risk
                            depending on the financial products that make up the strategy. Generally, financial products
                            with the potential for the highest returns may also carry the highest risk. Your level of
                            acceptable risk will vary compared to other investors’ risk appetite and will depend on a
                            range of factors such as your age, your investment timeframe, how comfortable you feel about
                            exposing your capital to risk, the nature and size of other investments you hold and the
                            extent to which CFDs/options fit into your overall financial plan.

                            The nature of CFDs/options allows BROKER to have a control or influence over the performance
                            or return of investment on CFDs/options. It is important to note that no return is
                            guaranteed. Future returns may differ from past returns and Clients may lose some or all of
                            their money invested. Additionally, laws (including tax laws) that affect CFDs/options may
                            change in the future which may have an adverse effect on your returns.

                            Trading CFDs/optionss offered by BROKER involves a high level of risk due to its speculative
                            nature. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that you obtain your own financial, legal,
                            taxation and other professional advice to determine whether these products are an
                            appropriate investment for you. BROKER limits your potential loss to the amount of money
                            deposited in your account by using a fixed amount, that may be lost and which is disclosed
                            to the Client before buying an option or CFD. However, as a result of a variety of
                            unsuccessful trades you may still sustain losses in amount of entire capital in your account
                            (deposit). Therefore, only risk capital should be invested i.e. money you can afford to
                            lose. This section include the significant risks that may affect your investments with
                            BROKER.

                                as the counterparty to every transaction. You
                                will therefore be exposed to the financial and business risks, including credit risk,
                                associated with dealing with BROKER.

                                Each Option is an over-the-counter contract and is not traded on an exchange or market.
                                You will not
                                be able to transfer or assign the CFDs/options to any other person. Only BROKER can
                                close your
                                Positions. OTC CFDs/options are not guaranteed by an exchange or clearing house, and

                                therefore face the risk that BROKER may fail to meet some or all of its obligations.

                                obligations. If BROKER were to become insolvent, then we may be unable to meet our

                                Clients must rely on BROKER to have in place appropriate arrangements to minimise the
                                risk that it will
                                not be able to meet its obligations

                                    You may use the CFDs/options to for the purposes of hedging risks associated with

                                    allows you to protect your losses from either product. There is the risk that even a
                                    fully hedged Position may suffer losses due to rollover costs, exchange rate
                                    fluctuations or widening spreads. In addition, while a hedged Position reduces
                                    exposure to decreases in the value of an option it will generally also reduce the
                                    potential for increased gains. If you are entering into an option for the purposes

                                    underlying transaction or the asset or liability which is being hedged.
